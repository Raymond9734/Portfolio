# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project built with React and Vite.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Raymond9734/Portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Portfolio
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```

This will start the server, and you can view your portfolio at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
